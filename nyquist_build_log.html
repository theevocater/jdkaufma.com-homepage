          <p>
            This is a full list of all the components you'll need to build and
            program the board. The parts list isn't too complicated, but there
            isn't a one stop shop so I've compiled a simple list here. All of
            these places ship from the US so you should be able to get the
            components in a week or two.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Board Kit. <a href="https://keeb.io/products/nyquist-keyboard?variant=48309345990">Keeb.io makes these boards</a>. The kit includes the diodes, the TRRS jacks, I2C resistors, and reset switches. You'll need a few other things though.</li>
            <li>Case. <a href="https://keeb.io/collections/cases-plates/products/stainless-steel-nyquist-plates?variant=46393243974">Keeb.io sells a simple case for the Nyquist.</a> They print and cut out 2 PCBs as the top and bottom plate with stand-offs. If you know more than I do, there are cases on thingverse that you could print on shapeways for a nice clean plastic look.</li>
            <li>2x Pro Micro. <a href="https://keeb.io/collections/split-keyboard-parts/products/pro-micro-5v-16mhz-arduino-compatible-atmega32u4">Keeb.io sells fairly cheap ones.</a> Just throw them in your cart with the case and board kit.</li>
            <li>TRRS Cable. Any will do, but Keeb.io has <a href="">one</a></li>
            <li>USB Micro Cable. <a href=""> </a></li>
            <li>Switches. This is a hard decision you are going to want to spend some time with. I used <a href="https://novelkeys.xyz/collections/switches/products/novelkeys-x-kailh-speed-heavy-switches?variant=3747975168040">NovelKeys x Kailh Speed Heavy Switches - Burnt Orange</a>. These are really heavy switches with a slight bump right at the top. I recommend checking out switches testers like <a href="https://novelkeys.xyz/collections/switch-testers">this one</a>. I also recommend <a href="https://input.club/the-comparative-guide-to-mechanical-switches/">Input.club's Guide</a>. They go into some good detail about the various types possible.</li>
            <li>Key Caps. This is mostly a question of taste. You are looking for an ortholinear set that has at least 60 keys with 5 rows. A basic one would be <a href="https://pimpmykeyboard.com/sa-ice-cap-keyset/">Pimp My Keyboard's "ICE CAP"</a> keyset. Make sure to purchase the "ortholinear" set.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            You'll need a few other pieces of equipment if you are totally new
            to assembling electronics. Make sure to have a soldering iron,
            solder, and wire cutters on hand. Teaching you how to solder is out
            of the scope of this guide, but it isn't incredibly difficult.
            Consult some youtube videos and practice soldering some wire or buy
            a practice board to start out.
          </p>
          <h3>Software</h3>
          <p>
            Right now you'll either need to be happy with the default keymap
            that comes flashed onto the pro micros or set up the QMK build
            chain. Head to
            <a href="https://docs.qmk.fm/getting_started_build_tools.html">their docs</a>
            and get everything set up. I'll walk you through flashing things
            later. Make sure you install everything for avr/atmega because that
            is what the pro micros use.
          </p>

					<h2>Assembly</h2>
          <h3>Prep</h3>
          <p>
            So all of your parts came in and you have a few hours of free time.
            You have a couple of important but boring prep tasks before you can
            assembly everything. I know, I know, but I promise that there are
            few things worse than having to desolder your pro micro's 24 pins
            because the one you bought was dead.
          </p>
          <h4>Test Pro Micros</h4>
          <p>
            Plug in the pro micros one at a time. Ensure that the voltage
            between VCC and GND pins is roughly 5V. If it is not, the pro micro
            is likely bad. This is a good time to test out that you have
            correctly set up your build environment. See <a href="https://docs.qmk.fm/getting_started_make_guide.html">their docs</a> again for more general make advice. 
            You are building a nyquist so the command should look roughly like
            the following.

					<p>
						To get that to work you'll need to briefly short the reset pin to ground when it says <span class="code">Detecting USB port, reset your controller now...........</span>. Once you wire the keyboard up there is a button to make this simpler.
          </p>
					<h4>Seat Switches</h4>
					<p>
						The next step is to seat all of the switches into the top cases.
            You will want to ensure you orient the switches correctly. The
            cutouts for 2u keys should be closer to you, and screw furthest
            from you should be close to the left for the left side, and close
            to the right for the right side. TODO: put photo here. Once you've
            fit all of them, check all of the pins on the bottom of the
            switches. Carefully bend any pins back straight, and if any are
            broken replace the switch.
					</p>
          <p>
            This is a good time to make sure everything else fits. Mount the
            standoffs on the top case and ensure the boards fit flush with the
            switches. If it doesn't, verify you didn't install a switch upside
            down.
          </p>
          <h4>Solder Diodes</h4>
          <p>
            Next, you'll assemble the diodes. First, bend the legs on each of
            the diodes. Place the diode against the flat of the case and then
            bend the leg around the side of the case.
          </p>
          <div>
            <img src="/static/nyquist_build_log/diode_bent.jpg" />
          </div>
          <p>
             You'll need 60 of them. The black line on the diode should be
             closer to the square pad.
          </p>
          <div>
            <img src="/static/nyquist_build_log/diode_soldered.jpg" />
          </div>
          <p>
            Once you've placed them all, solder them all. Trim the legs to be
            flush to the solder.
