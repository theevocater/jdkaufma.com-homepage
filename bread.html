      <h2>Simple FWSY Bread</h2>

      <p> Hello! Welcome to the recipe for a basic "FWSY" or "Flour Water Salt
        Yeast" bread. This is probably the simplest bread one can possibly
        make. I'm trying to keep this as simple and equipment light as possible
        so I'm going to list the things you absolutely need (like an oven and
        flour) and then a few extra things that you might want (like a bench
        knife). The extra things are all about making working with dough
        simpler and getting your results more consistent. Don't run out and buy
        everything on the list, just start with what you've got and maybe pick
        up things when you get frustrated with some part of your process!
      </p>

      <p>One last thing before we start: I'd love it if you send me a picture of
        your completed bread or your steps! Feel free to <a title="twitter" href="http://twitter.com/theevocater"> @ me</a>
        on twitter with your results or woes!
      </p>

      <div class="pure-u-1">
      <h3>Equipment</h3>

      <p>These are the necessary pieces you'll need.</p>

      <div class="equipment">
      <div class="pure-u-3-24">Big Bowl</div>
      <div class="pure-u-20-24">
        You need this to mix the ingredients and then to
        leave in to allow the dough to proof. Ideally its about twice the size
        of your dough.
      </div>
      </div>

      <div class="equipment">
      <div class="pure-u-3-24">Mixing spoon</div>
      <div class="pure-u-20-24">
        I prefer a hard wooden spoon to mix the dough. The recipe below is
        pretty tough to work with, so something strong will be needed.
      </div>
      </div>

      <div class="equipment">
      <div class="pure-u-3-24">Dutch Oven</div>
      <div class="pure-u-20-24">
        This will be our baking vessel. Dutch ovens work amazingly well because
        you can create a good "steam-y" environment for the first half of
        baking.  This is fairly difficult to obtain in your typical home oven,
        but you can work around with some oven steam hacks. I'll cover those at
        some point. A cast iron pan or baking tray or such will do.
      </div>
      </div>

      <div class="equipment">
      <div class="pure-u-3-24">Soft Towel</div>
      <div class="pure-u-20-24">
        This is just to cover the bowl during rise / proofing. If you let it
        free to the air (or in the fridge) the dough will dry out. A towel with
        a little water on it is your best bet for bowels without tops, but
        saran wrap done tightly will work as well.
      </div>
      </div>

      <div class="equipment">
      <div class="pure-u-3-24">Hands</div>
      <div class="pure-u-20-24">
        Kneading is hard work! Take it slow, and don't tax yourself. I mention
        this primarily for people with arthritis or other problems might have
        trouble. There are some pretty good techniques for dealing with this
        that I will try to write down at some point.
      </div>
      </div>

      <div class="equipment">
      <div class="pure-u-3-24">Counter space</div>
      <div class="pure-u-20-24">
        This one is tricky for us with small apartments but you'll need about
        4 by 3 feet square counter space. You might want to get a good large
          cutting board if your counters are sketchy.
      </div>
      </div>

      <div class="equipment">
      <div class="pure-u-3-24">Oven</div>
      <div class="pure-u-20-24">
        To cook the bread in. You'll need something that can hit ~450F. Oven
        temperature consistency is often the source of a lot of problems. You
        might want to get a oven thermometer to double check your oven's temp.
      </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        That is it! You can totally bake bread with the above equipment. Below
        I've listed some extra things that will make your life much easier.
      </p>

      <div class="equipment">
      <div class="pure-u-3-24">Kitchen Scale</div>
      <div class="pure-u-20-24">
        I hesitate to put this under "optional" because honestly if you want to get
        consistent results you have to get a scale. If you have one, try weighing
        4 cups of flour a few times. Results will vary wildly!  
      </div>
      </div>

      <div class="equipment">
      <div class="pure-u-3-24">Bench Knife</div>
      <div class="pure-u-20-24">
        When working with wetter doughs than we are working with here a bench knife
        makes it easier to work the dough and clean up.
      </div>
      </div>


      <div class="equipment">
      <div class="pure-u-3-24">Bowl Scraper</div>
      <div class="pure-u-20-24">
        A little piece of rounded plastic that makes it easy to get into all
        the corners of a bowl or bin. Super useful and super cheap.
      </div>
      </div>

      <div class="equipment">
      <div class="pure-u-3-24">"Lame"</div>
      <div class="pure-u-20-24">
        This tool has the worst name. This is essentially a razor blade
        attached to a stick. They are used to score the bread and make those
        pretty ears on a baguette. Ears allow air to escape in a controlled
        way and prevent blowouts. A (very) sharp knife can substitute.
      </div>
      </div>

      <div class="equipment">
      <div class="pure-u-3-24">Proofing Box</div>
      <div class="pure-u-20-24">
        I use a plastic food safe container with a lid. Easy to clean and
        frees up your bowls. Plus the lid means long ferments don't dry out
        your bread!
      </div>
