      <h2>Simple FWSY Bread</h2>

      <p> Hello! Welcome to the recipe for a basic "FWSY" or "Flour Water Salt
        Yeast" bread. This is probably the simplest bread one can possibly
        make. I'm trying to keep this as simple and equipment light as possible
        so I'm going to list the things you absolutely need (like an oven and
        flour) and then a few extra things that you might want (like a bench
        knife). The extra things are all about making working with dough
        simpler and getting your results more consistent. Don't run out and buy
        everything on the list, just start with what you've got and maybe pick
        up things when you get frustrated with some part of your process!
      </p>

      <p>One last thing before we start: I'd love it if you send me a picture of
        your completed bread or your steps! Feel free to <a title="twitter" href="http://twitter.com/theevocater"> @ me</a>
        on twitter with your results or woes!
      </p>

      <h3>Equipment</h3>

      <p>These are the necessary pieces you'll need.</p>

      <div class="equipment">
      <div class="name pure-u-md-3-24 pure-u-sm-1">Big Bowl</div>
      <div class="pure-u-md-20-24 pure-u-sm-1">
        You need this to mix the ingredients and then to
        leave in to allow the dough to proof. Ideally its about twice the size
        of your dough.
      </div>
      </div>

      <div class="equipment">
      <div class="name pure-u-md-3-24 pure-u-sm-1">Mixing spoon</div>
      <div class="pure-u-md-20-24 pure-u-sm-1">
        I prefer a hard wooden spoon to mix the dough. The recipe below is
        pretty tough to work with, so something strong will be needed.
      </div>
      </div>

      <div class="equipment">
      <div class="name pure-u-md-3-24 pure-u-sm-1">Dutch Oven</div>
      <div class="pure-u-md-20-24 pure-u-sm-1">
        This will be our baking vessel. Dutch ovens work amazingly well because
        you can create a good "steam-y" environment for the first half of
        baking.  This is fairly difficult to obtain in your typical home oven,
        but you can work around with some oven steam hacks. I'll cover those at
        some point. A cast iron pan or baking tray or such will do.
      </div>
      </div>

      <div class="equipment">
      <div class="name pure-u-md-3-24 pure-u-sm-1">Soft Towel</div>
      <div class="pure-u-md-20-24 pure-u-sm-1">
        This is just to cover the bowl during rise / proofing. If you let it
        free to the air (or in the fridge) the dough will dry out. A towel with
        a little water on it is your best bet for bowels without tops, but
        saran wrap done tightly will work as well.
      </div>
      </div>

      <div class="equipment">
      <div class="name pure-u-md-3-24 pure-u-sm-1">Hands</div>
      <div class="pure-u-md-20-24 pure-u-sm-1">
        Kneading is hard work! Take it slow, and don't tax yourself. I mention
        this primarily for people with arthritis or other problems who might
        have trouble. There are some pretty good techniques for dealing with
        this that I will try to write down at some point.
      </div>
      </div>

      <div class="equipment">
      <div class="name pure-u-md-3-24 pure-u-sm-1">Counter space</div>
      <div class="pure-u-md-20-24 pure-u-sm-1">
        This one is tricky for us with small apartments but you'll need about
        4 by 3 feet square counter space. You might want to get a good large
          cutting board if your counters are sketchy.
      </div>
      </div>

      <div class="equipment">
      <div class="name pure-u-md-3-24 pure-u-sm-1">Oven</div>
      <div class="pure-u-md-20-24 pure-u-sm-1">
        To cook the bread in. You'll need something that can hit ~450F. Oven
        temperature consistency is often the source of a lot of problems. You
        might want to get a oven thermometer to double check your oven's temp.
      </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        That is it! You can totally bake bread with the above equipment. Below
        I've listed some extra things that will make your life much easier.
      </p>

      <div class="equipment">
      <div class="name pure-u-md-3-24 pure-u-sm-1">Kitchen Scale</div>
      <div class="pure-u-md-20-24 pure-u-sm-1">
        I hesitate to put this under "optional" because honestly if you want to get
        consistent results you have to get a scale. If you have one, try weighing
        4 cups of flour a few times. Results will vary wildly!  
      </div>
      </div>

      <div class="equipment">
      <div class="name pure-u-md-3-24 pure-u-sm-1">Bench Knife</div>
      <div class="pure-u-md-20-24 pure-u-sm-1">
        When working with wetter doughs, a bench knife makes it easier to work
        the dough and clean up. This recipe won't need one.
      </div>
      </div>


      <div class="equipment">
      <div class="name pure-u-md-3-24 pure-u-sm-1">Bowl Scraper</div>
      <div class="pure-u-md-20-24 pure-u-sm-1">
        A little piece of rounded plastic that makes it easy to get into all
        the corners of a bowl or bin. Super useful and super cheap.
      </div>
      </div>

      <div class="equipment">
      <div class="name pure-u-md-3-24 pure-u-sm-1">"Lame"</div>
      <div class="pure-u-md-20-24 pure-u-sm-1">
        This tool has the worst name. This is essentially a razor blade
        attached to a stick. They are used to score the bread and make those
        pretty ears on a baguette. Ears allow air to escape in a controlled
        way and prevent blowouts. A (very) sharp knife can substitute.
      </div>
      </div>

      <div class="equipment">
      <div class="name pure-u-md-3-24 pure-u-sm-1">Proofing Box</div>
      <div class="pure-u-md-20-24 pure-u-sm-1">
        I use a plastic food safe container with a lid. Easy to clean and
        frees up your bowls. Plus the lid means long ferments don't dry out
        your bread!
      </div>
      </div>
      </div>

      <div class="pure-u-1">
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <p> </p>

        <ul>
          <li>20oz Unbleached Bread Flour, preferably above 12.5% protein content</li>
          <li>12oz Water, roughly 110F or "warm" tapwater</li>
          <li>.5oz Salt</li>
          <li>.36oz Instant Yeast</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="pure-u-1">
        <h3>Process</h3>
        <h4>Mix</h4>
        <p>
          After measuring all of your ingredients, mix together all the dry
          ingredients in a large bowl or a food safe container. Pour in your
          water and mix mix mix. This is where your bowl scraper will come in
          handy. After it turns into one wet ball, dump it out on a floured
          counter.
        </p>
        <h4>Knead</h4>
        <p>
          Now we knead. Kneading is simply stretching out the dough in
          different directions to cause the gluten to form long chains. This is
          what gives the bread "strength". The more you knead, the stronger the
          gluten chains will be. This gives your bread more spring and
          generally more "chewiness". The technique for kneading is: push the
          dough away from you with one hand, fold the dough back on itself, and
          turn 90ยบ. Repeat this for roughly ten minutes. The dough should feel
          soft to the touch, and when poked should feel kind of like the muscle
          on your hand under your thumb. Another test is to stretch a piece of
          dough and see if it stretches far enough to "see through". This is
          called the windowpane test.
        </p>
        <h4>Rise</h4>
        <p>
          Now we rise the dough. Throw it back in your container or bowl and
          cover. Leave it somewhere warm and dry for a few hours, checking it
          every 30 minutes. You want it to double in size. Time will vary
          greatly on your environment and specific ingredients. Once it
          doubles, press it back down and then let it rise again for the same
          amount of time.
        </p>
        <h4>Shape and Proof</h4>
        <p>
          Now we shape. Turn your oven on to 450ยบF to let it preheat. To create
          a basic boule, drop your dough back on your floured surface. Your
          goal is to create a sphere by pulling the dough down from north to
          south pole. Start by rolling the dough into a ball. Cup your hands
          under the ball and use your thumbs to pull the dough into shape. This
          is a gentle operation as you don't want to tear the dough. Pull,
          turn, and repeat until the top of the dough feels taught. The surface
          tention you are creating is how the dough holds its shape during
          baking. Return the dough to a lightly covered bowl for a final rise
          called the proof. Let it rest for 45 minutes to an hour. The dough
          when poked should not spring all the way back.
        </p>
        <h4>Bake</h4>
        <p>
          Baking! Get your dutch oven ready. Drop the bread with the taught
          side up in the dutch oven. Using a sharp knife or lame score the
          top of the dough ball. This gives the CO2 a way to escape as the
          bread cooks. Cover the dutch oven and bake. After 25 minutes remove
          the cover of the dutch oven and bake until the top is dark brown.
          This will probably be another 25 minutes but it can vary. If you
          aren't sure cook it longer, people often pull bread early.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the bread is cooked, pull the dutch oven out and turn the oven
          off. Remove the loaf and place it somewhere to cool. Resist the urge
          to cut the bread before its cool to the touch. Enjoy. You did it!
